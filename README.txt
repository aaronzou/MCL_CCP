This code is to implement contour-guided color palette segmentation method described in: 
"Robust Image Segmentation Using Contour-guided Color Palettes" by Xiang Fu, Chien-Yi Wang, Chen Chen, Changhu Wang and C.-C. Jay Kuo, in ICCV 2015.
It is written in MATLAB, and has been tested under 64-bit Windows, linux and Mac OSX.

To produce contour-guided color palette segmentation result and run "CCP_segmentation.m", you need three toolboxes that are already in the folder.
